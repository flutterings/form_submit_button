# Make use of FormState in a StatelessWidget Form.

A button to be used in a Form, which will pass the Form's state in the onPressed method.

## Why use StatelessWidget?

If you are using the [container/presentation pattern](https://efthymis.com/smart-dumb-components-in-flutter/) 
and want to use the Form as a presentation component, which most of the time you do, you would want 
somehow to get a hold of the FormState.
